# CheckMate

An interest-based companion finder app for Android.

An app that has everything you need to find partners for routine activities such as multiplayer sports, games, dining or travelling. The users can find and talk to people interested in the same thing as they are, through the app itself. The app finds and sorts through the peers to find the ones closest to the requesting user.

# So how does it work?

The user has to be logged in to use the app. The registration functionality is provided in the app itself.

A user who is interested in some activity, say for instance travel, would select the time duration for which he is available to be contacted and partenered with. During this time, the user can log in anytime to see the peers in his geographical location who are interested in the same thing.

A instant-whatsapp chat functionality is provided for the users interested in the same thing to discuss and decide on an appropriate time and/or place.
